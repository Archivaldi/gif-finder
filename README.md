# Gif-Finder

https://archivaldi.github.io/gif-finder/


App is created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax and Firebase-database.
Ajax calles API from Giphy.com
When you search for the gifs, you will get static gif, but if you click any gif, it will move!
App is mobile responsive, so you can check it out on any device!
You get 10 gifs at start, but if you want to get more, you can push button "Give me more" and you'll get +10 gifs.
You can add your favorites gifs into "Favorite gifs". I use Firebase for this feature.
Enjoy!
